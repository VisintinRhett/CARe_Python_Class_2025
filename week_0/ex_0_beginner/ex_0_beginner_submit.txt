The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

My name is Rhett Visintin, I am from the USA (born and raised in New York state, moved to South Carolina in 2014), and at 30 I am the oldest student in this course. My goal for learning a programming language is to be better able to understand and incorporate modelling and bioinformatics concepts in my work.

I am just old enough to have been alive before cell phones became ubiquitous, so the last time I was truly without access to a computer was likely on some kind of excursion into nature when I was a child, though I can't recall with any real precision when that was.
